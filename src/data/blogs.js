        Welcome to the LLM Guru! In today's video, I'll show you how to implement your own AI chatbot using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, two of the most powerful language models, into a web-based interface. I'm excited to guide you through this project. Let's get started!
  
        ### Step 1: Create an OpenAI Account
        Before diving into the code, we need to create an OpenAI account. Open up a new browser, log into the OpenAI website, click on the API link, and create a new secret key called "GPT Chatbot". Make sure to copy this key and store it safely, as you cannot access it later.
  
        ### Step 2: Set Up the Project
        Create a new folder and open it in VS Code. Open the terminal in VS Code and initialize a new Node.js project:
        \`\`\`
        npm init
        \`\`\`
        Install necessary extensions like JavaScript ES6 Snippets, ESLint, and a formatter like Prettier.
  
        ### Step 3: Install Required Packages
        Install the required packages:
        \`\`\`
        npm install openai body-parser cors dotenv
        \`\`\`
        Create a \`.env\` file to store your OpenAI API key and organization key.
  
        ### Step 4: Write the Code
        Follow the OpenAI documentation to configure the API. Import the necessary packages and set up the configuration in \`index.js\`. Write the code to handle API calls and process responses from GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.
  
        ### Step 5: Create a Web Interface
        Create a basic HTML file with a form to input messages and display chat logs. Use JavaScript to handle form submissions, make POST requests to the server, and display responses from the AI.
  
        ### Step 6: Run the Application
        Run the Node.js server and use a live server extension to host the HTML file. Test the chatbot by sending messages and receiving responses.
  
        Congratulations! You've successfully implemented GPT-3.5 into a web-based interface using VS Code, JavaScript, and HTML5. You can find the complete code for this project in the video description below along with additional resources to help you further explore GPT-3.5 and AI.
